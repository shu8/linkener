A fast, lightweight, fully-featured, self-hosted URL shortener written in Go.

## üìï Background

URL shorteners let you convert long ugly or scary links into short, more memorable links. Self hosting a URL shortener has a few advantages:

- you don't need to worry about a 3rd party service shutting down, rendering all your existing links useless
- you _own_ your data, can export it and query it however you like
- you can brand links with your own domain, or customize the design of pages
- you can give admin access to other trustworthy users really easily
- it's _much_ easier to get new features added and bugs fixed!

## ‚≠ê Features

Linkener (_Link_ Short*ener*) has a bunch of features:

- üê≥ Easy-install docker images available with minimal configuration required
- üîí Password protected short URLs
- üî¢ Maximum visit expiry for short URLs
- üí™ Self hosted -- own your data, brand your links, free forever
- üìà Visit tracking (currently only the referer's are recorded)
- üíæ Multiple storage backends (currently either a JSON file or SQLite database)
- üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Simple username/password login & registration
- üåê Easy to use, minimalistic admin panel (see [linkener-web](https://github.com/shu8/linkener-web))
- üíØ REST API to integrate with other services and generate access tokens for e.g. custom clients
- ‚öì _(coming soon!)_ Webhook support to be notified when a URL is visited

It's written in Go to be extremely lightweight, producing a single executable that can be run basically anywhere (Raspberry Pi, a cheap VPS, your laptop, anywhere!) with minimal resources -- if you don't want the load of a database server for a URL shortener that you're only going to use for a few 10s or 100s of links, you can set Linkener to simply use a JSON file, or SQLite database!

It's also really easy to add new features (see the [Contributing](#Contributing) section later)!

## üì• Installation

### Docker image

For many cases, using the Docker image (~20MB based on Alpine Linux) will be the easiest and fastest way to setup Linkener.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 shu8/linkener:0.1.0
```

This will start a container running Linkener on port 3000 (you can change this as desired).

If you want to tweak the config (see [Configuration](#Configuration)), just create a `config.json` file and run:

```bash
docker cp config.json linkener:/root/.linkener/config.json
docker restart linkener
```

### Docker compose

If you want to build a container yourself, you can use the included [Docker Compose file](./docker-compose.yml) to spin one up!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shu8/linkener.git
# Or git clone https://github.com/shu8/linkener.git if using HTTPS
# Make your changes to the docker-compose.yml file or the main code
docker-compose up -d
```

### Building manually

It's also really easy to build the project manually!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shu8/linkener.git
# Or git clone https://github.com/shu8/linkener.git if using HTTPS
go mod download && go build ./... && go install ./...
linkener
```

## ‚ñ∂ Usage

Running the `linkener` executable or starting a Docker container/image is enough to get Linkener running (by default, on port 3000).

By default, `linkener` will look for a `~/.linkener/config.json` file on start (this is done for you in the Docker image).

To override the config file location, use the `-c` or `-config` flag, for example:

```bash
linkener -c /some/other/dir/config.json
```

You **must** have a config file, even if it's just `{}` (missing properties mean to use the default values -- see [Configuration](#Configuration)). If a config file can't be found, the program will exit immediately.

### Making an account

Once `linkener` is running, you'll need to make an account first. You can do this quickly via the terminal:

```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME", "password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}' 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users'
```

...or use a GUI like the [official Linkener web interface](https://github.com/shu8/linkener-web):

### Using the Linkener web interface

A simple, easy to use web-app is available at [`linkener-web`](https://github.com/shu8/linkener-web), which can be built to a simple static site to be hosted using e.g. nginx. A Docker image/Docker Compose configuration is also available to easily get it running.

The web-app is a Progressive Web App so it can easily be 'installed' on mobile devices, and it lets you connect to any Linkener server with a public API!

</p>

**Check out installation instructions and more details at the [`linkener-web`](https://github.com/shu8/linkener-web) repository!**

### REST API & Redirects

Now, you can use the REST API to interact with Linkener. By default, the API can be found at `/api/` of the root domain. This can be configured with the `api_root` config setting.

Visits to the root will be treated as short URL requests, e.g. a short URL with slug `google` can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost:3000/google`.

If a password is required, the default password screen will appear:

**See the REST API docs [here](./API.md).**

## ‚öô Configuration

Linkener uses a JSON file to configure its behaviour. The possible fields, descriptions, and defaults are below. By default, Linkener will look for the config file in `~/.linkener/config.json`. See [Usage](#Usage) for details on how to override this location.

| Field name              | Default                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `auth_enabled`          | `true`                          | Whether login and access token authorization for the API is required (useful if running locally behind an existing login system).

| `redirect_root`         | `""`                            | The subpath at which the main Linkener redirect service should run, excluding the initial `/`. e.g. `link` means the redirect service will run at `/link/` of the root domain. This is useful when running Linkener on a subpath of an existing domain                                   |

## ‚ùì Why?

Why yet another URL shortener?

I wanted to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and love building projects, so a URL shortener seemed like a good starter project for me to learn lots of things about Go (and Docker!): the HTTP library, managing databases, reading/writing to files, containerizing Go applications, and so much more!

I also wanted to host a URL shortener on my website to be able to brand a few links but couldn't find anything lightweight (to run on a VPS that has lots of other services already running on it!), with all the features I wanted (password protection, easy logging in from anywhere, etc.), and was really easy to install and configure -- so I built one!

## üí° Inspirations

Linkener is inspired by many other _awesome_ open source URL shorteners. To name just a few: [Shlink](https://shlink.io/), [Polr](https://polrproject.org/), and [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/).
